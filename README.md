# Randomization-Trials
Randomization studies to determine inherent randomness in mainstream paradigms such as excel or python based RAND() &amp; RANDBETWEEN() 


Still a WIP - Examining differing ways of determining at what point too much randomness becomes inherently un-random. Tab 2 (Other Rand Options) on excel sheet demonstrates this potential principle, we'll name the Hord Pattern.

As each iteration of the Rand() & RandBetween() run, there are visual cells found within the coalescing matrix of connecting scatterplot lines. These cells are squares of cubes of their inherent integer, rounded down from the values found within a COUNT() of columns E and F. Determining a principle from this information is still occurring, however consulting tab 1 (Raw Data & Plots) There is a threshold to be found, upon which, quantum keys can be extrapolated to be the most 'Random' and the least 'Random'.

As you can see with the velow images, the coalescing pattern found within the interference creates a range of known even integers ranging from 2,4,8,9,12,16 and others I'm still discovering.

Would love input on this. If this work is used, please cite correctly.
